# cert-operator

Cert Operator creates/configure/manages certificates for Kubernetes clusters running on Giantnetes.

## Prerequisites

## Getting Project

Download the latest release: https://github.com/giantswarm/cert-operator/releases/latest

Clone the git repository: https://github.com/giantswarm/cert-operator.git

Download the latest docker image from here: https://hub.docker.com/r/giantswarm/cert-operator/

### How to build

#### Dependencies

- [github.com/giantswarm/microkit](https://github.com/giantswarm/microkit)
- [github.com/giantswarm/certificatetpr](https://github.com/giantswarm/certificatetpr)

#### Building the standard way

```
go build github.com/giantswarm/cert-operator
```

## Running cert-operator

The operator needs a connection to Vault (currently v0.6.4 is supported) and to
the Kubernetes API. For development running Vault in dev mode is fine.

### Setup

- The operator needs to connect to a Vault server. See [examples/vault.yaml](https://github.com/giantswarm/cert-operator/blob/master/examples/api-cert.yaml) for running Vault as a deployment with a ClusterIP service.
- The cert-operator binary needs to be built into a docker image and tagged as `quay.io/giantswarm/cert-operator:local-dev`. The current pod need to be deleted for changes to apply.

```
GOOS=linux go build github.com/giantswarm/cert-operator \
  && docker build -t quay.io/giantswarm/cert-operator:local-dev . \
  && kubectl delete pod -l app=cert-operator-local
```

- The docker image needs to be accessible from the k8s cluster. For Minikube see [reusing the docker daemon](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/blob/master/docs/reusing_the_docker_daemon.md).
- The operator also needs a connection to the K8s API. The simplest approach
is to run as a deployment and use the "in cluster" configuration.

```
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: cert-operator-local
  namespace: default
  labels:
    app: cert-operator-local
spec:
  replicas: 1
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: cert-operator-local
    spec:
      volumes:
      containers:
      - name: cert-operator
        image: quay.io/giantswarm/cert-operator:local-dev
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        ports:
        - name: http
          containerPort: 8000
        args:
        - daemon
        - --service.vault.config.address=http://YOUR_VAULT_HOST:8200
        - --service.vault.config.token=YOUR_TOKEN
        - --service.vault.config.pki.ca.ttl=1440h
        - --service.vault.config.pki.commonname.format=%s.g8s.aws.giantswarm.io
```

- Note: Edit YOUR_VAULT_HOST to point at your Vault endpoint.
- Note: This should only be used for development. See the [/kubernetes/](https://github.com/giantswarm/cert-operator/tree/master/kubernetes)
directory and [Secrets](https://github.com/giantswarm/cert-operator#secrets) for a production ready configuration.

### Creating TPOs (Third Party Objects)

- The [/examples/](https://github.com/giantswarm/cert-operator/tree/master/examples) directory contains a set of certificatetpr resources designed
to work with the [example cluster](https://github.com/giantswarm/aws-operator/blob/master/examples/cluster.yml) in the `aws-operator`.

```
for i in examples/*-cert.yaml; do kubectl create -f $i; done
```

- The certificates are issued using Vault and stored as k8s secrets.

```
kubectl get secret -l clusterID=example-cluster
```

### Cleaning up

- Delete the certificate TPOs and the deployment.

```
kubectl delete certificate -l clusterID=example-cluster
kubectl delete deployment cert-operator-local
```

### Secrets
The cert-operator is deployed via Kubernetes.

Here the plain Vault token has to be inserted.
```
service:
  vault:
    config:
      token: 'TODO'
```

Here the base64 representation of the data structure above has to be inserted.
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: cert-operator-secret
  namespace: giantswarm
type: Opaque
data:
  secret.yml: 'TODO'
```

To create the secret manually do this.
```
kubectl create -f ./path/to/secret.yml
```
